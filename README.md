# 🌐 Ports, Protocols, and Network Scanners 

This repository contains my **Ports, Protocols, and Network Scanners** lab, which demonstrates foundational knowledge of network communication, services, and scanning techniques.  
It blends theory with hands-on tools (Advanced IP Scanner, Nmap, Zenmap) to discover devices, open ports, and active services on a network.

## 📖 Overview

Networking is the backbone of IT.  
Understanding **TCP/IP, ports, protocols, and network scanning** is essential for troubleshooting, system administration, and security assessments.

In this lab, I created a structured **HTML guide** that explains how ports and protocols work and demonstrates how to:
- Identify active devices on a network
- Enumerate open ports and services
- Interpret scan results for network insights
